## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **npm** or **yarn**
- **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions
- **AWS Amplify CLI** (for backend setup)
- **Git**

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsantek/the-office-english-learning-platform-frontend.git
   cd teachsly
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up AWS Amplify** (if not already configured)

   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```

4. **Pull Amplify backend** (if backend is already deployed)
   ```bash
   amplify pull
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# GraphQL API Endpoint (optional - defaults to production API)
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT=your-amplify-graphql-endpoint

# Environment (prod, qa, dev)
REACT_APP_ENV=dev

# Google Analytics Tracking ID
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID=your-tracking-id

# Zoom Integration
REACT_APP_ZOOM_API_ENDPOINT=your-zoom-api-endpoint
REACT_APP_ZOOM_CLASSES_LINK=https://your-zoom-classes-link.com
```

### AWS Amplify Configuration

The `src/aws-exports.js` file is automatically generated by AWS Amplify. It contains:

- AppSync GraphQL endpoint
- Cognito User Pool configuration
- S3 bucket configuration
- Region settings

**Note**: This file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited. It's updated when you run `amplify pull` or deploy changes.

## 🏃 Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

### Clean Install

If you encounter dependency issues:

```bash
npm run install:clean
```

This command removes `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstalls dependencies.
